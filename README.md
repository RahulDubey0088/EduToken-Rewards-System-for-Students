# 🎓 EduToken: Reward Token for Educational Platforms

## 📌 Project Description  
**EduToken** is a simple, Ethereum-based reward token system designed for educational platforms. The contract enables an admin (e.g., instructor or institution) to issue tokens to students as a form of recognition or achievement. Students can also burn tokens after redeeming them for perks like certifications, digital assets, or other incentives.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision  
To create a decentralized, transparent, and fair reward system for learning environments where achievements are tokenized. EduToken empowers educators to motivate learners and promote engagement through blockchain-based rewards.

---

## ✨ Key Features  

- ✅ **Admin-Controlled Token Issuance**: Only the admin can issue reward tokens.  
- 🔥 **Burn Mechanism**: Students can burn tokens after usage or redemption.  
- 📊 **Transparent Balance Tracking**: Tracks individual balances and total token supply.  
- 🔐 **Access Control**: Secure modifier restricts reward issuance to admin only.  
- 💡 **Simple & Lightweight**: Gas-efficient and easy to integrate with any educational DApp.

---

## 🔭 Future Scope  

- 📤 **Token Transfer Support**: Allow token transfers between students or platforms.  
- 🏛 **Integration with Learning DApps**: Automate rewards based on task completion.  
- 🌐 **Frontend Dashboard**: Web interface to view balances and burn tokens.  
- 📜 **Certificate Issuance on Burn**: Issue on-chain certificates when tokens are burned.  
- 🧠 **Gamification Features**: Point system, badges, and ranks based on token activity.
