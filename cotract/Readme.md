# EduToken Rewards System for Students

## ðŸ“š Project Description
EduToken is a blockchain-based rewards system designed to incentivize and recognize the academic efforts of students. By issuing tokens for achievements such as assignment completion, good grades, or participation, educators can foster a more engaging learning environment.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized and transparent reward mechanism that motivates students, promotes educational excellence, and potentially connects academic performance to real-world benefits.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Reward Distribution**: Admins (educators) can issue EduTokens to students for completing specific academic tasks.
- **Token Burn**: Students can burn their tokens, simulating token usage or redemption for rewards.
- **Minimalist Design**: Simple, gas-efficient contract with just two main functions: reward issuance and token burning.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Integration with a frontend platform for real-time token tracking.
- Redeemable reward marketplace (vouchers, learning materials, etc.).
- Role-based access controls for multiple educators.
- Enhanced student dashboards using Web3.
- NFT badges for major milestones.
